Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the sustematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to to development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power modern life including communication, enternainment, commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming langages, the establishment of softare engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design-Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and UI.
Implementation-writing code and building software according to design specifications.
Testing-Ensuring the softare meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment- Releasing software to users/ customers.
Maintenance-Making sure the program works smoothly over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterflal methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing down like a waterfall whereas the agilemethodology is an interative, incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and respondig to change.
Waterfall is appropriate for projects where the requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change significantly, while agile methods are for projects that change frequently and have uncertain, complex requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes code and implements software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager-Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's provide the tools for writing, debugging and testing code i.e VS Code
Version Control Systems track changes to source code, coordinating work among team members ie Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines. Pressure to deliver software products on time can result in rushed development and compromised quality. Teams should subdivide work adequately to make it easier to complete projects within set deadlines.
Changing requirement. Teams should reassess project goals and timelines regularly to meet changing requirements during the development cycle.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
